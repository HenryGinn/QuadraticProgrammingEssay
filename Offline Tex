For a feasible region in $n$ spacial dimensions, we will enforce $n$ constraints to be active at any given time. If these constraints are linearly independent then there will only be a single point where these constraints all hold with equality. This can be seen by forming an $n$ dimensional linear system from those constraints and solving it. As we have $n$ dimensions and $n$ linearly independent equations, the rows of the matrix system form a basis for the space, therefore a unique solution to it exists. An example of two linearly dependent constraints would be $x \ge 0$ and $\x le 3$. These constraints do not intersect so they cannot both be active at the same time, and we will see later how this situation is avoided later. We note that there can be multiple choices of $n$ constraints being forced to be active that lead to the same intersection point. For example, any two of the three equation, $x = 0$, $y = 0$, and $x + y = 0$ all intersect at 0. A consequence of this is that if a constraint is not chosen to be active, this does not imply that it is not active - it could be active by coincidence.

We now introduce a way of controlling whether constraints are imposed to be active or not. For an inequality, $c^Tx \le b$, we introduce a slack variable, $s = b - c^Tx$. This gives us the equation $c^Tx + s = b$, and if we enforce that $s = 0$ then we must have $c^Tx = b$, and we gain control over whether the constraint is active. This converts all our inequalities into equalities, although for the inequalities to remain valid we need to ensure that all our slack variables remain positive as $s \ge 0 \iff b - c^Tx \ge 0 \iff c^Tx \le b$. We see that the feasible region can be described as the polytope where all spatial variables and all slack variables are non-negative, $x_1, \dots x_n, s_1, \dots, s_m \ge 0$. There are $n + m$ inequalities here, and we know from the above that enforcing $n$ of them to be active will define a unique point (as long as the corresponding constraints are linearly independent). These inequalities are coupled via the $m$ equations that define the feasible region.

The origin can be described as the point where all the non-negativity constraints for the spatial variables are active, $x_1 = \dots = x_n = 0$. If we look at the $n$ equations the value of the slack variables can be seen immediately. For each equation we have $c_i^Tx + s_i = b_i$, and substituting in $x_1 = \dots x_n = 0$ gives $s_i = b_i$ where $i = 1, \dots, m$. The reason that the value of the slack variables can be seen without calculation is because each slack variable only appears in one equation - they are decoupled. The system has been written as a set of explicit equations for the slack variables. Now we move away from the origin and attempt to describe a different vertex. Suppose we impose that $s_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = \dots = x_n = 0$. This means that we will move along the positive $x_1$ axis until we hit the constraint that originally corresponded to $s_1$. Assuming for now that we do hit that constraint, we are now at the vertex defined by the intersection of this constraint and the hyperplanes $x_2 = 0, \dots, x_n = 0$.

We want to rearrange our system of equations so that it no longer gives the values of $s_1, \dots, s_m$, and instead gives the value of $x_1, s_2, \dots, s_m$. The equation for $s_1$ can be rearranged for $x_1$ by simple algebra, and we have finished manipulating the first equation. Recall that when we were at the origin the equations were written for a set of variables that were decoupled, and we aim to do the same here. To do this, we need to eliminate $x_1$ from all the other equations. This can be done easily however as our first equation that we have just modified is exactly an equation for $x_1$ that can be substituted into the other equations. After this has been done we have a system where the values of $x_1, s_2, \dots, s_m$ can be read off as all the other variables have been imposed to be 0. This process is known as pivoting. In the above we assumed that if we moved along the $x_1$ axis that we would hit a constraint, and we now look at the case where that does not happen. There are three situations we could be in.

Case 1 - the equation corresponding to $s_1$ was not a function of $x_1$. This means that the $x_1$ axis either lies within the $s_1$ constraint hyperplane, or it is parallel to it. This can be seen by taking the dot product with the plane normal and the vector pointing in the direction of the $x_1$ axis. If the first of these subcases occurs then it means 

Case 2 - the $s_1$ constraint intersects the $x_1$ axis where $x_1 < 0$. In this situation the equation is a function of $x_1$, but the intersection is infeasible. This happens when the coefficient of $x_1$ is negative. We have the equation $s_1 = b - c_{11}x_1 - \dots - c_{1n}x_n$
